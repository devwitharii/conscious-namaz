            <h3>What is the Tahajjud Namaaz?</h3>
            <p>As Muslims we have five prayers that are Farz(compulsory) and the sixth prayer is optional but also the most virtues Nafl prayer. This prayer is called the Tahajjud Namaaz. Since this night time prayer is not obligatory, very few of us withdraw the real benefit from it (i.e. the power of manifesting anything pure).</p>
            <p>Be it nurturing your spirit by experiencing a deeper connection with Allah, or be it healing your physical and mental body, or manifesting your perfect life, everything is graciously available if you "consciously surrender" to the real power of Tahajjud Namaaz.</p>

        <ProgramContainer>
            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>As mentioned in one of the most sacred Hadees (Sacred texts written by Prophet’s companions), Sahi-al-Bukhari (1145) narrated by Abu Huraira,</p>
            <p>Allah's messenger said "Our Lord, the blessed, the Superior, comes every night down on the nearest heaven to us when the last third of the night begins, saying: Is there any one to invoke me, so that I may respond to your invocation? Is there anyone to ask me, so that I can grant him his request? Is there anyone seeking my forgiveness, so that I may forgive him".</p>
            <p>As much this sacred moon-light prayer reflects significance in some of the well-known Hadees, Allah acknowledges and emphasizes on this prayer in the Holy Quran. One of the verses from the Holy Quran states, "Indeed, worship in the night is more impactful and suitable for recitation. For during the day, you are over occupied by worldly duties. Always remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to him wholeheartedly" (Qur'an 73: 6-8)</p>
            <p>The sacredness of night time worship has been outlined by modern science as well. At night when we take a break from our sleep and perform any sacred ritual, our mind stays in a state of total reception, absorbing the vibrations of every word from the Qur'an to the cellular level of our body. Every Dua asked to Allah at this sacred hour comes to life because the mind is free from other worldly obligations and it consciously makes space for the miracles of Tahajjud Namaaz to shower over you.</p>

            <h3>How will this program help you pray the conscious way and reap all the benefits?</h3>
            <p>At Conscious Namaaz we practice "feeling" the Namaaz and the dua's we offer, followed by tons of gratitude as Allah is an all giver (we just need to learn how to ask). It's like how it works in our physical lives. If you had to ask your father or friend for something you like to have, there is a way to ask for it, if you ask in the wrong way or a very feeble way, your chances of "not" getting it are intellectually higher. It sounds very simple, yet backed up with 1400 years of rich Islamic history and scientific understandings of modern times. As quantum science today claims, "feeling is the prayer", we are only inclined towards making your heart more grateful and prayerful while opening all the gates of receptivity to your desired dua's. By guiding you on every step towards praying consciously, we will help you manifest anything your heart desires, be it health, wealth or prosperity.</p>

            <h3>BLUEPRINT OF THE PROGRAM</h3>
            <p>This three-day program is conducted in two sessions each day. The first session will be scheduled at 9PM and the second session will be hosted at 2AM. The evening sessions are mainly focused towards understanding how conscious praying is performed and the newly discovered science behind it, followed by questions and answers to any queries by the participants.</p>
            <p>The 2AM session is officially Tahajjud Namaaz time. This session will be completely guided and all the participants will perform a two Rakaat Tahajjud Namaaz followed by a powerful Islamic Meditation & Dua.</p>
