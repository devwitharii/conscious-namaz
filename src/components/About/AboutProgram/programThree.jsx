                    <p className='lg:text-lg leading-[1.5]'>The power of group meditation is way bigger than we can actually think. The vary reason a lot of duas (during Namaaz and after Namaaz) are asked to Allah in big groups of people at the mosques is to have a super amplified impact of the Dua. The power of pouring the same intent at the same time in groups is beyond imaginable. If you are seeking some desire to manifest that is very important to you like sending healing prayers for a loved one’s recovery or have a very important job or business deal to fall into place or desiring to marry the perfect partner, this program is for you. </p>

                <h3>Itinerary of the program</h3>
                <p>This meditation session will be hosted in small groups of people (maximum ten people) to create a strong bond of energy towards the intent every participant desires to manifest. Once the intent is connected between every participant, we combine that with a Muraqabah and Zikr to amplify what we are asking Allah for.</p>
                <p>Be it nurturing your spirit by experiencing a deeper connection with Allah, or be it healing your physical and mental body, or manifesting your perfect life, everything is graciously available if you "consciously surrender" to the real power of Tahajjud Namaaz.</p>
